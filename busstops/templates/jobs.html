<h1>Jobs</h1>

<p>Come and work on bustimes.org – the #3 UK ground transportation website, according to <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/bustimes.org/#overview">SimilarWeb</a>. So far I’ve been a one-person company, but in 2024 it’s time to hire the first employee or two.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>have some experience of web/software development.
        You don’t need to be familiar with all of our
        <a href="https://github.com/jclgoodwin/bustimes.org">technology stack</a>
        (Python, Django, TypeScript) or public transport data yet, but it might be relevant if you are
    <li>care about building fast, accessible websites
    <li>have some ideas for making bustimes.org better
    <li>have the right to work in the UK
</ul>

<p>Depending on your particular specialisms, you might be working on (for example):</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>The bustimes.org API – it’s currently undocumented and incomplete, but could eventually power new apps, websites and hardware</li>
    <li>User experience improvements – the website is too often described as “clunky”</li>
    <li>Helping with the business side of the business</li>
    <li>Your own ideas</li>
    <li>New projects</li>
</ul>


<ul class="bulleted">
<li>
    Location: remote (anywhere) or hybrid (Norwich?)
<li>
    Full-time/part-time/freelance
<li>
    Full-time annual salary: £30,000–£50,000
</ul>
